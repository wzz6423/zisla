  # Sparkle installs later versions itself, so `brew upgrade` replaces the app only when
  # the installed bundle really is behind the tap; Homebrew 5.1.6 and later read the
  # version inside the app, while naming the cask or --greedy goes by Homebrew's own
  # install records and can undo a Sparkle update. Sparkle reads the appcast for this
  # slice, so an in-app update keeps the install on a single architecture.

  caveats <<~EOS
    zisla is not notarized, so macOS quarantines it on first launch. Open it once
    from System Settings > Privacy & Security by
    choosing "Open Anyway", or clear the quarantine attribute yourself:

      xattr -d com.apple.quarantine "#{appdir}/zisla.app"

    zisla needs Accessibility and Screen Recording permissions for the top-edge
    workspace, and asks for them on first use.
